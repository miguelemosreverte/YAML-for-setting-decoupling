#### Efficient Programming Course

This repository shows how to use the YAML format to achieve setting decoupling, by making the program read them from an external source.

The following settings are dynamic:

* The output directory choosen for the saving of the report

* The command used to append each report to the saved files, which allows for decorators

* The transformations to be applied over the commands, ie.: The replacement of the placeholder filenames for the actual filenames

* The commands used to make the profiling of the files

* The files to be profiled

* The commands used to report on the output of the profiling commands

* The extensions of the procedurally generated files to be deleted afterwards
